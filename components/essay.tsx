        Even before Macbeth's first murder, the manifestation of guilt in the
        mind is made clear by the First Witch, while she tells her story of
        tormenting a sailor, {" "}
        <span className="duration-150 rounded-md" id="q1">
          “Though his bark cannot be lost, / Yet it shall be tempest-tossed.”
          (1.3.24-25).
        </span>{" "}
        The reference to the individual's "bark" (referring to their external
        appearance) being tempest-tossed reflects the internal storm of guilt.
        Despite the appearance of stability, the individual's mind is in
        constant turmoil due to their guilt, symbolized by the metaphor of being
        tossed by a tempest. This is shown in my collage “Tempest of the Mind”,
        the person represents the physical body, and appears to be perfectly
        fine, but above them is a storm forming, and their ship being torn
        apart, this represents a person's true state of being. Even though the
        person looks fine, they are about to be in a storm, and without a ship.
        This is similar to what Macbeth will go through, as while he will look
        fine physically, he will have a very hard time sleeping, and will slowly
        go insane from seeing ghosts of the people he has killed.

        Guilt's effect on Macbeth's mind becomes clear after He
        kills King Duncan, he immediately begins to torment himself over the
        murder. While on his way to meet up with Lady Macbeth, he begins to hear
        a voice, and he recounts what it says to Lady Macbeth.{" "}
        <span className="duration-150 rounded-md" id="q2">
          “‘Sleep no more!’ to all the house; ‘Glamis hath murdered sleep, and
          therefore Cawdor shall sleep no more, Macbeth shall sleep no more.’”
          (2.2.44-46).
        </span>{" "}
        This voice is not real, only Macbeth can hear it, the voice crying
        “Sleep no more”, is a manifestation of the guilt that Macbeth is
        feeling, he is so guilty that he is punishing himself for what he has
        done to the king, he is hallucinating a voice telling him that he will
        no longer be able to sleep for his actions. This moment is depicted in
        my image “No Sleep”. In the center of the frame is Macbeth, and all
        around him, is more of himself, at night, wide awake in various forms of
        torment from his lack of sleep. Macbeth confirms the effects that guilt
        is having on his mental state, in a conversation with Lady Macbeth,{" "}
        <span className="duration-150 rounded-md" id="q3">
          “Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep / In the affliction of
          these terrible dreams” (3.2.18-19).
        </span>{" "}
        Macbeth is expressing fear and tormenting his feelings, he and Lady
        Macbeth have just killed Duncan, and Macbeth has just given the order to
        kill Banquo, his best friend. He is now always afraid that people may
        learn of the murder he committed, and his dreams are filled with the
        horrors of his murders. The fear and torment that comes with guilt is
        made clear in my image “Torment of the Mind”, it demonstrates this by
        showing Macbeth and Lady Macbeth in the top right, with scared somber
        expressing, and around them are symbols for what they have done,
        Banquo's skull, and Lady Macbeth standing over the dead Duncan in his
        bed, while she is hiding the murder, those parts of the college are
        filled with a red tone, and surrounded by fire to show the evil in the
        moment, and Macbeth and Lady Macbeth are in gray, to show the torment
        and fear that they are experiencing.

      <span className="block indent-5 leading-loose">
        In the end, Guilt forces Macbeth to go into denial, after the feast,
        Macbeth opens up about his troubles to Lady Macbeth. He has just seen
        Banquo’s ghost, and sends everyone away after he has a bit of breakdown
        during the feast, he is then confronted by Lady Macbeth about his
        actions that night, to whom he says, {" "}
        <span className="duration-150 rounded-md" id="q4">
          “Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse / Is the initiate
          fear that wants hard use: / We are yet but young in deed”
          (3.4.144-145).
        </span>{" "}
        Macbeth's guilt is causing him to go into denial from his terrible
        actions. He knows it was wrong murdering Banquo, and now he is
        subconsciously punishing himself for it, by having Banquo's ghost
        torment him. But despite all of these visions, he does not accept that
        his actions were wrong, instead he says that he should sleep, showing
        that he wants to hide from his guilt and regret, and hoping that it will
        go away in time. I show this in my image “Strange Visions”, by having
        Macbeth, in the center of the image, holding his head in, and facing the
        floor, with an expression of torment on his face, while he is surrounded
        by ghosts. My image shows how Macbeth is trying to hide from his
        actions. Once again, Macbeth's guilt forces him to go into denial of the
        reality of his situation, when he is being told prophecies from the
        apparitions that the witches summon, he is told earlier in the play,
        that Banquo’s children will be King after him, but he is told by the
        apparition that he can't be killed by anyone born of a women. Macbeth
        chooses to ignore the obvious contradiction between these two
        prophecies, and says {" "}
        <span className="indent-0 duration-150 rounded-md" id="q5">
          “Sleep in spite of thunder” (4.1.108).
        </span>{" "}
        Macbeth is saying that despite everything that is predicted to happen to
        him, and everything that he has already done, he will ignore it all and
        “sleep”. I show this in my college, by showing Macbeth in the center of
        the frame sleeping. Below Macbeth is Banquo, from the movie dead on the
        train, and to the left of that is Banquo dead from the play. Above
        Macbeth is Duncan, killed in his sleep, to the left of Duncan, is
        Macduff, who is not dead, but who Macbeth wants to kill. The entire
        image is tinted red, to show the evil of Macbeth's actions, and Macbeth
        sleeping represents him trying to ignore everything evil that he has
        done.
