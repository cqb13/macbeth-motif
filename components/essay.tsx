        In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, the theme of guilt is prominently
        portrayed through the lens of sleep, revealing the profound effects it
        has on the human mind.
      </span>
      <span className="block indent-5 leading-loose">
        Shakespear shows the effect that guilt can have on the human mind, even
        before Macbeth's first murder. On his way to kill King Duncan, Macbeth
        witnesses a floating dagger in the air and begins to address it,
        stating, {" "}
        <span className="duration-150 rounded-md" id="q1">
          "Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse / The curtain'd sleep;
          witchcraft celebrates / Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder"
          (2.1.50-51).
        </span>{" "}
        In this moment, Macbeth engages in an internal battle with himself
        regarding the decision to kill Duncan. Consumed by guilt, he grapples
        with the idea of murdering a man who has done so much for him. The
        appearance of the dagger provides him with an opportunity to reconsider,
        to resist taking the dagger and abandoning his plan to kill Duncan.
        However, Macbeth ultimately chooses to take the dagger and proceed with
        the murder. My image, "Conflict Within," portrays the struggle within
        Macbeth. The image depicts a dark hallway, with one half bathed in red
        light representing the dark path Macbeth can choose to take, and the
        other half tinted white symbolizing the path of goodness he could remain
        on. At the border between the two halves stand two figures: Macbeth. One
        figure is more prominent, shaded in red and holding a dagger,
        representing the evil path he is inclined to follow. The other figure is
        black, lacking detail and fading away, representing the past Macbeth.
        This fading figure signifies the potential loss of his virtuous self as
        he descends further into darkness.
      </span>
      <span className="block indent-5 leading-loose">
        The impact of guilt on Macbeth's mind becomes evident after he murders
        King Duncan. Immediately after the deed, he torments himself over the
        act. While on his way to meet Lady Macbeth, he begins to hear a voice
        and recounts it to her,{" "}
        <span className="duration-150 rounded-md" id="q2">
          “‘Sleep no more!’ to all the house; ‘Glamis hath murdered sleep, and
          therefore Cawdor shall sleep no more, Macbeth shall sleep no more.’”
          (2.2.44-46).
        </span>{" "}
        This voice is a manifestation of Macbeth's guilt, as only he can hear
        it. The voice crying "Sleep no more" punishes him for his actions,
        indicating his guilt and suggesting he will be plagued by sleeplessness
        as a result of the murder. I depicted this in my image, "No Sleep." In
        the center, Macbeth is surrounded by various forms of himself, wide
        awake and tormented throughout the night. The image symbolizes the
        consequences of Macbeth's guilt on his mental state. Macbeth reinforces
        the effects guilt has on him in a conversation with Lady Macbeth, {" "}
        <span className="duration-150 rounded-md" id="q3">
          “Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep / In the affliction of
          these terrible dreams” (3.2.18-19).
        </span>{" "}
        Macbeth expresses the fear and torment he experiences. Having killed
        Duncan and given the order to kill his best friend, Banquo, Macbeth
        lives in constant fear of exposure, resulting in terrifying dreams
        haunted by his crimes. The fear and torment that accompany guilt are
        depicted in my image "Torment of Mind." It portrays Macbeth and Lady
        Macbeth in the top right corner, their expressions filled with fear and
        sorrow. Surrounding them are symbols of their deeds: Banquo's skull and
        Lady Macbeth standing over the dead Duncan in his bed. These elements,
        highlighted with a red tone and surrounded by fire, represent the evil
        of the moment. Macbeth and Lady Macbeth are depicted in gray, reflecting
        the torment and fear they experience. Overall, Macbeth's guilt takes a
        toll on his mental state, leading to hallucinations, sleeplessness, and
        torment.
      </span>
      <span className="block indent-5 leading-loose">
        In the end, Guilt forces Macbeth to go into denial. After the feast,
        Macbeth opens up about his troubles to Lady Macbeth, having just seen
        Banquo's ghost. He sends everyone away, experiencing a breakdown during
        the feast. Lady Macbeth confronts him about his actions that night, to
        which he responds, {" "}
        <span className="duration-150 rounded-md" id="q4">
          “Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse / Is the initiate
          fear that wants hard use: / We are yet but young in deed”
          (3.4.144-145).
        </span>{" "}
        Macbeth's guilt causes him to deny his terrible actions. Although he
        knows that murdering Banquo was wrong, he subconsciously punishes
        himself by being tormented by Banquo's ghost. Despite these haunting
        visions, he refuses to accept the wrongdoing and instead seeks solace in
        sleep, hoping that his guilt and regret will eventually fade away. To
        depict Macbeth's attempt to hide from his actions, my image titled
        "Strange Visions" portrays Macbeth at the center, holding his head and
        facing the floor with a tormented expression. Surrounding him are
        ghosts, representing his inner turmoil. This image serves as a visual
        representation of Macbeth's desire to conceal his guilt. Once again,
        Macbeth's guilt compels him to deny the reality of his situation. When
        the witches summon apparitions to deliver prophecies, Macbeth is told
        earlier in the play that Banquo's children will be kings, yet he is also
        told that he cannot be killed by anyone born of a woman. Despite the
        obvious contradiction between these two prophecies, Macbeth chooses to
        disregard it, declaring,{" "}
        <span className="indent-0 duration-150 rounded-md" id="q5">
          “Sleep in spite of thunder” (4.1.108).
        </span>{" "}
        By using this phrase, Macbeth indicates his determination to ignore the
        consequences of his actions and continue living in denial. In the image
        I have created, Macbeth lies at the center, sleeping. Below him is
        Banquo, depicted as dead on the train, while Banquo's deceased form from
        the play is positioned to the left. Above Macbeth, Duncan, killed in his
        sleep, is shown, and to the left of Duncan is Macduff, whom Macbeth
        intends to kill. The entire image is tinged with red, symbolizing the
        evil nature of Macbeth's actions. Macbeth sleeping represents his
        attempt to avoid confronting the darkness he has unleashed.
      </span>
      <span className="block indent-5 leading-loose">
        Shakespeare utilizes sleep to illustrate the impact of guilt on the
        human mind. Through Macbeth's journey, we witness the gradual unraveling
        of his sanity as he grapples with the consequences of his heinous
        actions. The portrayal of hallucinations, sleeplessness, and his
        desperate attempt to find refuge in sleep serves as a reminder of the
        destructive power of guilt, ultimately leaving us with a profound
        understanding of the torment that guilt can inflict upon the human
        psyche.
